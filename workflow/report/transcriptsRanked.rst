| The plot shows all transcripts ranked according to their normalised expression. *NFLR* = normalised expression per transcript (mean of normalised expression across all samples)
|
| For perSample plot in case multiple samples were detected, the bar represents the mean expression across samples (NFLR) and the error bars show the standard deviation.
