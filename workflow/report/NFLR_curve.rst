| Main plot: The plot represents the number of transcripts detected as a function of varying expression thresholds. If multiple samples were detected, the shaded area shows the standard deviation across the samples. *NFLR(T)* = normalised expression per transcript (mean of normalised expression across all samples)
|
| Per Sample plot for multiple samples: The plot represents the number of transcripts detected in every sample as a function of varying expression thresholds. *NFLR(i)* =  normalised full-length read count in sample *i*.
